## Collaborating
- For each Tech Review article a subfolder should be created inside the /articles folder (e.g. /articles/prefect).
- Images and other files related to each article should be stored in the article folder.
- Each Quick Exploration Pack should be created as a Github repository of its own and only a link to it should be included in the summary here, this will make it really easy to clone the packs locally and start playing with them
